It is like giving food to a child who is hungry. The hormones can make cancer grow much like food makes a child grow.  Because the type of breast cancer that you have is sensitive to hormones, your doctor has asked you to take anti-hormone medicine for the next five years.  This will help prevent the cancer from coming back.  If you take the food away from the cancer, it won't grow."
