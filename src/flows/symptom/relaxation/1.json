Stress is our bodyâ€™s natural response to an actual or perceived threat. Over time, stress can lead to chronic stress, which is when you feel stressed or overwhelmed at all times.  Chronic stress may get in the way of managing everyday tasks. Learning to manage stress can be helpful in improving stress levels and coping with things in life that cause stress."
