With that in mind, XXXX set a goal of pulling weeds from their garden for 10 minute increments, followed by 15 minutes of rest. After one week of following this plan, XXXX was able to increase their gardening time to 15 minute increments followed by 15 minutes of rest. After another week, XXXX was able to increase their gardening time to 20 minute increments followed by 15 minutes of rest."
