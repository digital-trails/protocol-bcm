For example, imagine that XXXX (womanâ€™s name used in example) deals with joint pain on a regular basis. XXXX has been meaning to clean up the weeds in their garden, but has avoided this task in fear of worsening their joint pain. As a result, the weeds have become overgrown.  One Saturday, XXXX finally decided to remove the overgrown weeds from their garden. So, XXXX spent 5 hours removing weeds from their garden on that Saturday. For the next two days, they experienced high levels of joint pain in their wrists and were unable to do very much for those two days."
