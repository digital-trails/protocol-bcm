Sometimes people travel very far away or change time zones, which makes it difficult to stick to the routine to take their medicine.  Other people forget to pack their medicine entirely or run out of it before they get home.  Sometimes people are moving from place to place and they forget their medicine somewhere.  This module provides some tips to help remember to take your medicine when traveling."
